# Risk Analysis on Load Defaulters

The scope of this analysis is on applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in the context of risk analytics within the banking and financial services sector.
The objective is to leverage EDA techniques to gain insights into minimizing the risk of losing money while lending to customers as well not neglecting the potential client for loan repay.

### Business Objective
 The project aims to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default. By identifying strong indicators of default, the company can use this knowledge for portfolio management and risk assessment.
 The analysis is geared towards providing actionable insights to improve decision-making in the lending process.
 
### Problem Statement
It involves conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to address risk analytics challenges in consumer finance.
The focus is on understanding patterns that differentiate clients with payment difficulties from other cases.
The final deliverables include an IPython notebook explaining the thought process, code, and visualizations, along with a PDF presentation file containing key points, visualizations, and insights.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes 3 file which are "application_data.csv", "columns_description.csv" & "previous_application.csv". These file combined has over 17,00,000 rows & 159 features related to customers preferences & personal information.

## Approach
The approach is as follows:

### 1. Missing Data Handling
- Identify missing data using appropriate methods.
- Replace missing values with the mean for numerical columns and mode for categorical columns.

### 2. Outlier Identification
- Detect outliers in the dataset using statistical measures.
- Define outliers without removing any data points.

### 3. Data Imbalance Analysis
- Analyze data imbalance in the target variable.
- Addressing the ratio of data imbalance.
- Utilize a mix of univariate, bivariate & multivariate analysis to understand the impact of data imbalance.

### 4. Univariate, Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis Results
- Conduct univariate and segmented univariate analyses to derive business insights.
- Employ bivariate analysis to understand relationships between variables.
- Using Heatmap to understand the corealtion beteween features.
- Present results in business terms, explaining their significance.

### 5. Visualizations and Summarization
- Include visualizations in Python to explain numerical and categorical variables.
- Summarize important results, emphasizing variables crucial for differentiating clients with payment difficulties from all other cases.
